First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Ioannis Fudos, for his invaluable guidance, feedback, and support. As an advisor, he always made time, was extraordinarily patient, and his suggestions were instrumental in the completion of this thesis.

I am also grateful to the friends I’ve made over the years — their camaraderie has made my academic journey truly worthwhile.

This journey wouldn't have been possible without them, so finally — but certainly not least — I extend my deepest gratitude to my family. Without their encouragement, boundless support, and unwavering belief in my potential, my works would never have reached fruition. \newline

I dedicate this thesis to them.
