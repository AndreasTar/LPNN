Version **6000.0.38f1** was used during the development of this thesis, so it is recommended to use that one. However, different versions
may also be functional with no issues. I will not implement the tool for multiple versions soon, so use at your own risk, as mentioned in the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file.

The project contains various test maps to use for testing and evaluating the model.

Feel free to fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/) and open a Pull-Request in case you want to provide an improvement to the tool in any way. The original repo before any significant
altercations will be preserved using a branch and a release.

For more details, feel free to check out the complete Thesis presentation, found in the [*Thesis_Report_code/main.pdf*](../Thesis_Report_code/main.pdf) file under the [*root (parent)*](..) folder, or found [here](https://github.com/).
