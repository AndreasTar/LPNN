This folder contains the Python 3.12 code for training the LPNN AI model using tensorflow, numpy and keras, and onnx for saving.

The necessary libraries can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or any other preferred method.

It also contains a small model snapshot to use for testing, under the [*models/*](models) folder, along with some data that can be used to train a model under
the [*data/*](data) folder.

The code may be altered later on to improve readability and fix edge-cases.
